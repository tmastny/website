My name is Tim Mastny and I am a student at the University of Nebraska Omaha studying statistics. I'm researching applied Bayesian analysis and time-series methods for complex surveys. 

Previously I worked in the aerospace industry, interning at NASA and working at Boeing OKC. Right now I'm an adjunct professor at Metro Community College and working towards graduation.
